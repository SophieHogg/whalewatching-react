# WhaleWatching - a movie tracking application

## Languages:

-   JavaScript (React)
-   SQL
-   HTML
-   CSS

## Overview

This is a passion project to convince myself to watch more movies. It utilises React for the front end and an SQL database for the data. It intends to document every movie (and potentially TV show) watched from 2022-09-09.

## Intentions

-   Cards for each movie - including movie name, two main actors, director and release year
-   Movie Page with further information, including a rating, date watched, and an image of the movie cover
-   Link database with SQL

## Aesthetics and Graphic Design

Because of the name 'whalewatching', I decided to go with a watery theme for this app, with lots of blues and greys. For the 'pop' of colour, which is necessary to draw the eye to specific parts of the page, I decided to go with an ochre colour and some more purply tones. However, I didn't want to make the page too bright as I wanted more of a relaxed atmosphere.

My references for colour palettes were:

I also utilised Canva's colour palette generator.

## Motivations

-   Convincing myself to watch more unqiue movies as opposed to rewatching the same movies over and over
-   More experience with React and SQL, and learning how to link the two, and create more complex tables

### Progress Update (2022-09-10)
